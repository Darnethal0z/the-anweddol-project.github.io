            <p>We are always in search of new ideas and enhancements to improve the Anweddol project. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways to help for the cause : </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Maintain / Test / Review the source code</h3>
                    <p>The Anweddol implementations source code are mostly written in Python. </br></br>If you want to contribute, see the contribution guidelines of the affiliated repositories. You can also become a contributor, mail the project on the <a id="text-anchor" href="social.html">[Social]</a> section.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Report bugs / errors</h3>
                    <p>Nothing is perfect, but everything can be improved. </br></br>If you see an error or an unexpected behaviour during the usage of one of the implementations, you can report it on the affiliated repository issues page, and feel free to propose corrections or alternatives.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Bring new ideas and enhancements</h3>
                    <p>Anweddol being a young project, it still needs some improvements and new features to be enhanced: You can bring you own ideas regardless of the domain on the several platforms that you can retrieve on the <a id="text-anchor" href="social.html">[Social]</a> section.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Promote the cause</h3>
                    <p>The project's cause must be widely spreaded in order to be a healthy and reliable one : Any kind of promotions are welcome. If you want to promote the cause, you are free to use any assets provided <a id="text-anchor" href="imgs/">[here]</a> and on this website.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Assist other users</h3>
                    <p>One of the characteristics of a community-driven project is that its members can help each other to alleviate the difficulties they may encounter when using one of the Anweddol implementations. Peoples who are familiar with Anweddol can be of assistance on help forums or miscellaneous platforms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
